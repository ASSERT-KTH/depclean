Make sure the title of the issue explains the problem you are having. Also, the description of the issue must clearly explain what is broken, not what you want us to implement. Go through this checklist and make sure you answer "YES" to all points:

* You have all pre-requisites listed in README.md installed
* You are sure that you are not reporting a duplicate (search all issues)
* You say "is broken" or "doesn't work" in the title
* You tell us what you are trying to do
* You explain the results you are getting
* You suggest an alternative result you would like to see
